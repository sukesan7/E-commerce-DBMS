# E-Commerce Database Management System

This open-ended project was created in a group of 4 to demonstrate our understanding of OracleDB and SQL. This project is designed for an e-commerce website database system, where many attributes and tables are created and stored. 
Near the end of the project, a UI was created so that the user may have a friendly way of interacting with this database system.
